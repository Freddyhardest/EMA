<ul>
    <li>These are all pages for the wesbite. I have divided the webpage into web app pages and web site pages. Those used for updating, member authorisation and banking details are web app pages, while the others are web site pages. This is to help organise my thinking, primerily as web app pages require more security without compromising user friendliness. I only plan to use this as a theoretical model during wireframing.
  I plan to show a photo of O.U. students walking on this page and put member validation on the walk events page as this may be more convenient if I member changes their membership status while meeting on a walk.
Finally I plan to provide instructions to update membership on the "update membership" page as this may be useful to new users of the website and to explain the partially offline storage method I have chosen to use."</li>
